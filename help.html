        <h3>Chapter 1 - How to setup the Quest 2 for QuestCave</h3>
        <p>
            In order for QuestCave to recognize your Quest 2 device via USB. You will need to take a few steps.
            So here we go
        </p>
        <h5>Step 1:</h5>
        <p>
            Go to the Meta developer website and either login or create a new account. Its basically
            your Facebook account.
        </p>
        <span class="blank-link">https://dashboard.oculus.com/</span>
        <h5>Step 2:</h5>
        <p>
            Now create a new Organization. Youre setting up a developer account for testing VR apps
            on Quest 2 devices as well as other Meta products. Don't worry this completly free!
            and reversible if you dont want to use this feature anymore. However, if you choose not
            to then you cannot get those great games for free.
            Anyway, if you're feeling brave like me then put any name you want for your organization
            and agree to the terms of service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: If you're a Windows user and as the time of writing this I havent built a Mac or Linux
            version of this app so you will be a Windows user, you will need to download and install
            an extra windows driver so Windows can recognize the Quest 2 device. I have provided the link
            below for you...
        </p>
        <span class="blank-link">https://developer.oculus.com/downloads/package/oculus-adb-drivers/</span>
        <p>
            download and install then reboot the computer. Youre almost there...
        </p>
        <h5>Step 3:</h5>
        <p>
            As a Quest 2 user, you should already have the Oculus app installed on your mobile device. Turn on your
            Quest
            if it isn't already, open the Oculus app on you phone, go to 'Menu' section on the bottom right hand side,
            go to 'Settings'.
        </p>
        <img src="" alt="Picture of Quest 2 app">
        Make sure your headset is marked as 'Connected' within the app, head into 'Developer Mode', then simply toggle
        it on. Reboot your Quest now.
